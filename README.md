# Hi! I'm Alan Asmis ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Software Engineer, Product Owner, and Technical Trainer passionate about building solutions, teaching, and leading teams. With over 6 years of experience, Iâ€™ve led and contributed to a wide range of projects and technologies, including .NET Core, Angular, node, and AI technologies. From maintaining legacy monolithic systems to managing a team of 15+ developers, Iâ€™ve driven the development of 70+ microservices, microfrontends, PWA apps, and native applicationsâ€”all within a monorepository with CI/CD pipelines.

My expertise is rooted in distributed systems, particularly in the cruise industry, where data consolidation happens intermittently. Iâ€™ve led and implemented these systems across the globe, collaborating with diverse teams to ensure seamless deployment in various cruise companies worldwide.

As an autodidact and entrepreneur at heart, I spend my free time developing independent tools and apps, including sales platforms, large event ticket systems with distributed devices, and AI-driven solutions.

I thrive on challenges and always give my best to tackle them. Whether leading or collaborating, I enjoy teaching, sharing tools, and continuously learning, all while striving to deliver top-quality results and help others grow.
